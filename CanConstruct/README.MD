# <center> Time/Space Complexity</center>

    For this analysis we consider:

    m = length of current string
    n = length of the wordBank array

    stackoverflow comment to consider (WHY METHOD SBSTRING IS O(N))
        Precisely because Strings are immutable, .Substring must make a copy of at least a portion of the original string. Making a copy of n bytes should take O(n) time.


## <center> Brute force </center>
---

    Time: O(n^m * m)
    Space: O(m^2) 

    Time: n-ary tree of height of m and n as possible number of children times m, which is the cost of method substring.
                
    Space is the maximum height of the tree, because its the length of the recursive stack in the memory * the o(m) space taken by each substring generated by this method.

## <center> Memoized </center>

    Time: O(m*m*n)
    Space: O(m^2) 

    Time: Since its memoized, I will never have to go up in the tree again to recalculate x, where 1 <= x <= m.
    So for each branch in the tree we have m*n possibilities times m, which is the cost of method substring.

    m possible values for the nodes;
    for each x , where 1 <= x <= m, we have n possibilities.
